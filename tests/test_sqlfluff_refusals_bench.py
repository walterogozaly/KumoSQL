"""sqlfluff's refusal cases: KumoSQL's structural rules must decline or prove (see tools/sqlfluff_fixtures_bench.py).

The 212 cases are the structure-rule (ST) and CV12 fixtures with no ``fix_str``: queries sqlfluff leaves alone, often
because a rewrite would change the meaning (a correlated derived table, a data-modifying CTE, Jinja). They are stored
in benchmarks/sqlfluff_rule_cases/refusal-cases.json (MIT, licence next to it), so no download is needed. ``FLOORS``
only goes up; every case that is refused, caught or unsupported is a regression case that must never become wrong.
