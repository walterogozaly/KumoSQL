"""sqlfluff's rule fixtures: zero wrong verdicts and floors on what is proven (see tools/sqlfluff_fixtures_bench.py).

The 850 fail/fix pairs are stored in benchmarks/sqlfluff_rule_cases (MIT, credit in the licence file next to them), so
these tests need no download. ``FLOORS`` only ever goes up. Every case that is not proven or checked is a
regression case: it may improve, but it must never turn into a wrong verdict.
