"""The independent re-derivation of the provers' own bare-column resolution (``proof_columns``).

The SMT compiler picks a source for every bare column, the algebraic normalizer writes ``a.x`` for a bare ``x``
and the scoped-identity check hands the question to sqlglot's qualifier. ``proof_columns`` reads the statement's
text again, builds the scopes itself and says which FROM item owns each bare column. Fault injection corrupts a
prover's resolution and requires the check to refuse the proof; with the check off the same proof is certified.
