"""QueryBooster's experiment rewrites: pinned counts, zero wrong verdicts and per-pair regressions.

The QueryBooster files (GPL-3.0) and WeTune's schema dumps are downloaded at a pinned commit on
first use (see tools/querybooster_bench.py); the tests that need them skip when they cannot be
fetched. The full run goes through ``python tools/querybooster_bench.py``; here a fixed subset
keeps the test short.
