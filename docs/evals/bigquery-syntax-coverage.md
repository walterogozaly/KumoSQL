# BigQuery and Dataform syntax coverage

`tests/fixtures/bq_syntax/` is a checked-in manifest of small, valid cases, one per construct: every GoogleSQL statement family (query syntax, pipe syntax, DDL, DML, procedural language, transactions, DCL, `EXPORT DATA`/`LOAD DATA`, search and vector functions, JSON, geography, `ML.*`, UDFs, wildcard tables, `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, quoting) and the Dataform action types (table, view, incremental, operations, assertion, declaration, test), their config options, the `ref`/`resolve`/`self`/`when`/`incremental()` helpers, `js` blocks and includes, plus whole-project layouts (`workflow_settings.yaml`, `dataform.json`, `actions.yaml`, the JavaScript API).

```
tests/fixtures/bq_syntax/
  manifest.json        every case: id, file, kind (sql or sqlx), feature tags
  sql/<family>/*.sql   one construct per file (GoogleSQL)
  dataform/sqlx/*.sqlx one construct per file (Dataform)
  dataform/projects/   whole-project layouts
  dry_run.json         BigQuery dry-run result for each case
  known_gaps.json      the gaps below, one entry per case and stage
```

SQL cases read the test bed's `raw_users` and `raw_order_items` or public datasets, so they can be dry-run against project `kumosql`; a few name objects that do not exist (a remote model, a connection, a bucket), which only the dry run can tell apart from a typo.

## What each stage means

Each case runs through every stage that applies. A stage is **✅ pass**, **⚪ unsupported** (KumoSQL or sqlglot says so explicitly and nothing is damaged) or **❌ fail** (a crash, a lost reference, a changed meaning). Only ✅ and ⚪ can be committed: a ⚪ must be listed in `known_gaps.json` with who owns it, so a new gap fails the test suite until it is fixed or written down.

| Stage | What is checked |
|---|---|
| parse | sqlglot's BigQuery dialect parses the text into a structured statement (not an opaque `Command`) |
| load | the case loads as a model (`.sql`) or action (`.sqlx`) without a diagnostic |
| refs | (Dataform) every literal `ref()` and config `dependencies` entry is a graph edge |
| graph | graph, column lineage and report build without error, and the tables the statement reads appear as reads |
| fingerprint | (single queries) the output-comparison SQL built around the query is valid |
| cleanup | the cleanup and rewrite rules run, and their result is proven equivalent or left unchanged |
| format | `format_sql` neither crashes nor changes meaning; backticked names are untouched; the result is proven equivalent |
| prover | the SMT prover returns a verdict or "unknown" for the query compared with itself, and never crashes or calls it different |
| dry run | BigQuery accepts the SQL (`dryRun`, never billed). ✅ accepted; ⚠ parsed, then stopped on something outside the SQL (an object, connection, session or permission the project lacks); ❌ rejected; – not submitted (administrative statements, and Dataform actions that need the Dataform compiler) |

Run it yourself:

```
python -m pytest tests/test_bq_syntax_coverage.py          # every case x stage
python tools/bq_syntax_coverage.py --failures              # list failures
python tools/bq_syntax_coverage.py --markdown out.md       # the table below
python tools/bq_dry_run_manifest.py --project kumosql      # free dry runs; needs BQ_ACCESS_TOKEN or ADC
```

After a change that closes (or opens) a gap, run `python tools/bq_syntax_coverage.py --update-known-gaps` under each supported sqlglot version (CI tests 26.0.0 and the latest) and delete the entries that now pass.

See also [the behaviour eval](bigquery-behavior-eval.md), which executes rewrites of GoogleSQL compliance queries and BigQuery edge cases and compares results.

## What this found and fixed

- A nested `name:` (a documented column called `name`, a `{ name, schema }` entry in `dependencies`) renamed the action. Config keys are now read at the top level only.
- `${ctx.ref()}`, `${resolve()}`, `${ctx.self()}` and config `dependencies` were not graph edges.
- Dataform test `input "x" { ... }` blocks were treated as SQL; they are now preserved like `config`.
- The formatter upper-cased backticked routine paths (``DROP FUNCTION `p.d.f` `` became `` `P.D.F` ``), and the equivalence check called that proven. Quoted names are now restored exactly.
- `CREATE TABLE/VIEW ... AS SELECT`, `INSERT ... SELECT` and `EXPORT DATA ... AS SELECT` in `.sql` files had no reads in the graph; they do now.
- A `.sql` file with a `config { }` block is loaded as an action instead of failing to parse.
- Table-valued function calls that pass a table (`FROM dataset.fn(TABLE dataset.input, option => value)`) failed to parse ("Expecting )") in sqlglot's BigQuery parser, so the model lost every read. `kumosql.bigquery_syntax` wraps the BigQuery dialect's `parse` once for the whole package (not the parser itself, so it works on pure and compiled sqlglot alike): SQL sqlglot rejects is parsed again with `TABLE x` arguments marked, the table is read, the SQL prints back unchanged, and the columns the function returns are reported unknown (`untraceable_source`), never attributed to a table named like the function. When the project defines the function (`CREATE TABLE FUNCTION`), the call is read as the function's query and its columns trace to the source ([scripts.md](../scripts.md#table-functions)). Covered by `tests/test_table_function_arguments.py`.
- Analytical corpora ([analytical-sql-coverage.md](analytical-sql-coverage.md)) found that the formatter re-cased unquoted table and column names (BigQuery table names are case sensitive), and that windows and `ORDER BY ... LIMIT` blocked every proof; the `query/analytical_*` cases cover them.
- Formatting a statement sqlglot cannot parse or keeps as an opaque command (DDL for reservations, policies and indexes, `LOAD DATA`, `CALL`, `REPEAT`, `CHANGES(TABLE ...)`) was never proven, so it could not be accepted. A change that only moves whitespace and re-cases reserved keywords and built-in calls is now proven by comparing tokens. Formatting also re-cased user-defined function names (`f(x)` became `F(x)`), which are case sensitive; it now keeps them.
- Cleanup rewrote pipe-syntax queries into sqlglot's standard-SQL translation, and once into a broken query (`FROM t |> AS u` lost its table). Pipe syntax is now left as written.
- A file mixing statements sqlfluff can parse with one it cannot (a `GRANT`, `EXPORT MODEL`, a `CASE` script statement) was not formatted at all; each statement sqlfluff can parse is now formatted and the rest are kept as written.
- The read check counted the table a `REVOKE` names as a read; like `GRANT`, it is not one.
- Pipe `|> SET c = e` and `|> DROP c` did not parse; they are read as `|> SELECT * REPLACE (e AS c)` and `|> SELECT * EXCEPT (c)`, which BigQuery defines them to mean. `|> RENAME` is not: it keeps the column in its place, which no `SELECT` can say without the column list, and a translation that moved it could let a prover equate queries whose columns are in different orders.
- `GRAPH_TABLE(graph MATCH ... RETURN ...)` did not parse; the call is now kept as its own text (printed back unchanged, never read as a table) and the rest of the query is read as usual.
- `ML.` functions sqlglot does not know (`ML.EVALUATE`, `ML.DETECT_ANOMALIES`, `ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT`, and on sqlglot 26.0.0 `ML.GENERATE_TEXT` and `AI.FORECAST`) did not parse because of their `MODEL m` argument. The model argument is kept as its text (a model is not a table) and `TABLE t` arguments are read as tables; functions sqlglot reads itself, such as `ML.PREDICT`, are left to it.
- `SELECT WITH DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY` stays unparsed on purpose: read as a plain query, its noisy aggregates would look exact to every prover. Its table reads still come from the token fallback.
- `DROP TABLE FUNCTION` did not parse; `bigquery_syntax.py` now reads it as a drop of kind `TABLE FUNCTION`. Script cleanup gaps closed by [the script reader](../scripts.md) are no longer listed.
- Raw bytes literals (`br'a\d'`, `rb".."`) did not parse; they are read as the `b'..'` literal with the same bytes. Pipe `|> WITH y AS (...)` did not parse; it is read as a `WITH` at the front of its query, but only when nothing before it spells a name it defines and the query has no `WITH` of its own (otherwise moving it could change what a name means).
- An outside GoogleSQL feature checklist (287 entries from the BigQuery reference and release notes, 2026-10-02) was checked against BigQuery: 31 of its 154 single-statement query examples were not valid GoogleSQL. The 119 distinct valid queries are kept in `tests/fixtures/googlesql_checklist.json` (source noted there), and `tests/test_googlesql_checklist.py` checks on every sqlglot build that each parses and prints back to SQL that reads the same. Four are recorded as not read yet: `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` (sqlglot's BigQuery tokenizer lacks the keyword, and reading it needs column lineage for `MEASURES` first), a parenthesized join that starts with `UNNEST`, the `WITH(a AS 1, a + 1)` expression, and pipe `RENAME` (on purpose, above). The same check found two false proofs, now fixed ([provers.md](../provers.md)): bytes literals that differ only in backslash escapes, and `CAST` to a parameterized type.
- sqlglot read a string, bytes literal or backticked name that runs onto a second line without triple quotes (`'a<line break>b'`), which BigQuery rejects as an unclosed literal, so the provers equated it with `'a\nb'`. `bigquery_syntax.py` now rejects it as BigQuery does; triple-quoted literals still span lines.
- Fixtures themselves: the dry run caught 20 fixtures that were not valid GoogleSQL (qualifying a backticked table by its short name, unsupported `DEFAULT` arguments, `JSON_KEYS` on a string, and so on); they were corrected and re-checked.

## Gaps that are not fixed here

- **sqlglot** keeps procedural statements (`DECLARE`, `IF`, `LOOP`, `BEGIN ... END`, `CALL`, `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`) and many `ALTER`/`DROP`/`CREATE` forms (reservations, indexes, aggregate and remote functions) as opaque commands, and cannot parse `LOAD DATA`, `CHANGES`/`APPENDS`, `UNION ... CORRESPONDING` and some pipe operators. KumoSQL leaves such statements untouched and says so. Which cases fail differs between sqlglot 26.0.0 and the latest, so `known_gaps.json` holds the union of both.
- **Scripts** are read by KumoSQL's own splitter ([scripts.md](../scripts.md)), so the graph reads of `MERGE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` and scripts work even where sqlglot's `parse` stage still lists a script case as a gap (sqlglot cannot parse `BEGIN ... END` and procedural statements). Dynamic `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` and undefined `CALL`s stay unknown.
- **sqlfluff** cannot parse `GRANT`/`REVOKE`, `EXPORT MODEL`, remote functions and models, property graphs, some literals and a few other statements, so they are not formatted (`parse_error`, or `statements_not_formatted` when other statements in the file are).
- **Project layouts**: `projectSuffix`/`datasetSuffix`/`namePrefix` are ignored, the Dataform JavaScript API in `.js` files and `actions.yaml` are not read (`tests/test_bq_syntax_projects.py`, as xfail).
- **Computed references**: a `ref()` whose argument is computed in JavaScript is reported as unresolved rather than guessed.
- **Prover** (owned by the SQLSolver work): unknown, never wrong, for `LIMIT`, window functions, `TABLESAMPLE`, unaliased subqueries and nondeterministic aggregates.
