# Incremental models: does the incremental run equal a full refresh?

A Dataform incremental table runs its full query once, then on later runs only the `when(incremental(), ...)` form, appending (or merging on `uniqueKey`). It is correct when, after every batch of source changes, the table equals what a full refresh would produce. `kumosql.incremental` checks that.

```python
from kumosql.incremental import SourceTable, check_incremental, parse_incremental_sqlx

model = parse_incremental_sqlx(sqlx_text, target="orders_inc")       # ${self()} resolves to this
sources = {"events": SourceTable({"id": "INT64", "ts": "TIMESTAMP", "v": "INT64"}, key=("id",), time_column="ts")}
verdict = check_incremental(model, sources, kinds={"insert_new", "insert_late"})
verdict.outcome          # "safe" | "diverges" | "unknown" | "unsupported" | "timeout"
verdict.counterexample   # for "diverges": initial rows and batches that replay the failure
```

## What it models

The simulator (DuckDB) follows Dataform's run cycle:

* The first run builds the table with the full query; later runs apply the incremental query.
* Incremental `pre_operations` run first (for example a `DELETE FROM ${self()} ...` reload window).
* Without `uniqueKey` the result is appended. With it the run is a BigQuery `MERGE`: a target row matching more than one source row is an **error** (BigQuery raises), and NULL keys never match, so such rows are inserted again every run.
* `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` is pinned to a per-run clock; audit columns are excluded by name (`ignore_columns`) rather than making every run differ.
* `${self()}`, `${ref()}`, `when(incremental(), a, b)` and `when(!incremental(), a)` are evaluated; any other interpolation is refused (`unsupported`) rather than guessed. SQLX splitting reuses `kumosql.sqlx`.

Source changes are DuckDB/ANSI DML; model SQL is BigQuery. DuckDB is where results are executed, so BigQuery behaviour that DuckDB does not share (type coercion, `MERGE` rules) is modelled explicitly as above or not claimed.

## Contracts

A contract is the set of source-change kinds allowed: `insert_new`, `insert_late`, `insert_boundary` (same event time as the newest), `duplicate` (exact re-delivery), `update`, `update_touch` (update that also moves the event time to the newest), `delete`, `null_key`, `empty` (a run with no change). `tables` restricts which source tables change. "Safe" always means *under that contract*; there is no contract-free correctness.

## Verdicts

* **safe**: a proof rule applies. R1 (append): no `uniqueKey`, strict watermark `ts > COALESCE((SELECT MAX(ts) FROM self), <old date>)`, row-wise single-table query, only in-order inserts. R2 (merge): `uniqueKey` equal to the source's declared key, `>` with `insert_new`/`update_touch`, or `>=` or a `TIMESTAMP_SUB` lookback also allowing `insert_boundary`. Assumptions are in the `prove_watermark` docstring.
* **diverges**: a random search over change sequences allowed by the contract found one on which the model differs from a full refresh (or fails), shrunk by dropping batches and statements while it still diverges. It is returned with the verdict and replays on its own.
* **unknown**: no proof rule applies and the search found nothing. This is bounded evidence, not a proof.

## Scores

`python tools/incremental_bench.py` runs the corpus in `tests/fixtures/incremental/` and reports counts per outcome; the README scoreboard has two rows (detection, evidence `executed`; proofs, evidence `proof`).

| | cases | result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diverging cases refuted | 33 | 33, 0 false alarms |
| Safe cases proven | 16 | 11 proven, 5 unknown, 0 false proofs |
| Held-out (12 blind cases) | 12 | 9/9 refuted, 3/3 proven |
| Baseline (first 37 cases, before generalising the proof rules) | 37 | 24/24 refuted, 2/13 proven |

The five unknowns are de-duplicating merges (`QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER`), a re-aggregating merge, a pre-operation reload window, a day-granular watermark and a join against an unchanged dimension: correct models the proof rules do not cover.

**How cases are labelled.** Each case is authored with a label for its contract and a scripted change sequence. A fidelity check replays the script in the simulator and requires the outcome to match the label (this caught two authoring mistakes in the blind set). Detection never sees the script. Authored cases are original; adapted material (pg_ivm, the fixture repository) is recorded separately when added. No existing eval covers incremental maintenance (the SQLSolver, R-Bot, SQL-IQ and rewriting evals compare queries, not run histories); `synthetic_check` checks rewrites on random data and is the nearest related code.

**Caveats.** The proof rules and the change generator were developed on the 37 dev cases, so the dev numbers are optimistic; the held-out set is small. Every failure found is kept as a case.
