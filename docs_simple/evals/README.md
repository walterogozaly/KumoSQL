# Understanding the evaluations

[All simple guides](../README.md) · [Full reference and results-file index](../../docs/evals/README.md)

An evaluation, or eval, is a repeatable test suite measuring a feature. Some use public SQL test cases; others generate projects whose expected behavior is known in advance. None calls a language model while deciding the results.

## Read a score carefully

“X/Y, 0 wrong” needs two questions: what counts as success, and how was correctness checked? An equivalence proof, a bounded check, and agreement on executed data are different evidence levels.

An unknown answer is allowed. A false proof or a rewrite accepted despite changing results is a bug. A suite can avoid wrong answers by declining everything, so coverage and usefulness matter too.

**Held-out** cases were kept out of development. **Tuned on test** means developers used those cases while building the feature. **Adapted** SQL was changed to fit a dialect or test harness; it is reported separately from original SQL.

For comparing slow evals between code versions, see [Eval diff](eval-diff.md).

Feature guides also explain evaluations for [model reuse](../model-reuse.md), [join ordering](../joinorder.md), [output properties](../output-properties.md), [constraint-dependent rewrites](../constraint-rewrites.md), [incremental models](../incremental.md), and [scripts](../scripts.md).

## Find numbers or rerun a suite

Use the [full eval index](../../docs/evals/README.md) to find each `benchmarks/results/*.json` file. Its `command` field is the rerun command, and its date and caveats describe the measurement. The [project scoreboard](../../README.md#benchmark-scoreboard) displays those recorded results.

From a development checkout, `python tools/run_tests.py --evals` runs the benchmark floor tests. Full corpus runs can require downloads, databases, or hours of execution; read the matching full guide first. When adding a docs page, add its simple counterpart and index entry too.
