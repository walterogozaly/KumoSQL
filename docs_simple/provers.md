# How KumoSQL checks whether queries match

[All simple guides](README.md) · [Full reference](../docs/provers.md)

None of these checks uses the network. Calling a prover or a rewrite from Python makes no request; the one optional lookup (the columns of tables the project does not define) is off unless you turn it on. See [pipeline analysis](pipeline-analysis.md).

Two queries are equivalent when they return the same results under the comparison's rules. Usually that means the same rows with the same duplicate counts, ignoring unspecified row order. Column names, types, ordering, and declared data guarantees can also matter; read the check's assumptions.

Suppose you replace `WHERE 1 = 1` with no WHERE clause. A checker can establish that the removed condition never filtered anything. More complicated changes need stronger reasoning.

## The different kinds of checks

| Check | What a successful result establishes |
| --- | --- |
| Structural proof | After safe simplifications, both queries have the same supported structure |
| SMT / algebraic proof | Mathematical reasoning establishes equivalence for the supported SQL under listed assumptions |
| Bounded verification | No difference exists in the model for any database up to a stated row limit |
| Executed comparison | Both queries matched on the particular datasets tested |
| BigQuery dry run | The statements plan and, for a rewrite check, their output schemas match |

The first two can give an unbounded proof: the database's row count has no fixed test limit. The bounded check covers every modeled value combination, including NULLs, within its row bound. Random-data execution only covers the databases actually tried. A dry run does not compare returned values.

## Which prover is which?

The structural prover compares normalized query trees. The SMT prover uses Z3, a solver that reasons about constraints. The algebraic prover treats duplicate row counts as arithmetic, helping it reason about joins, unions, and aggregates. The optional Java SQLSolver backend is a separate setup; ordinary Python proofs do not require Java.

From a checkout, install solver and execution support with:

```sh
python -m pip install ".[smt,execution]"
```

A small Python example:

```python
from kumosql import prove_equivalent

result = prove_equivalent(
    "SELECT id FROM orders WHERE 1 = 1",
    "SELECT id FROM orders",
)
print(result.status.value)  # proven_equivalent
```

## Comments

A comment such as `-- note` does not change what a query returns, so it does not stop two queries from being proven the same. The one exception is a comment holding a Dataform `${...}` expression: Dataform fills those in even inside comments, and the result can turn into real SQL, so such a comment is compared like code. For example `SELECT 1 AS a -- note` and `SELECT 1 AS a` are proven the same. See the [full reference](../docs/provers.md) for details.

## Moving a subquery into a WITH

Before comparing two queries KumoSQL moves each subquery in a `FROM` into a `WITH` so both sides are in the same shape. A subquery that reads a column of the query around it, or a table a nested `WITH` defines, would mean something else once moved, so it stays where it is and the comparison is made with it in place. Without this, a lifted form that no longer ran could be called equal to the query it came from. A column with no table in front of it, read over a real table, still counts as that subquery's own; KumoSQL cannot tell without the table's columns. See the [full reference](../docs/provers.md).

## Which table does a bare column belong to?

In `SELECT id, name FROM orders JOIN customers ON ...`, the provers have to work out for themselves which table `id` and `name` come from, and inside a subquery whether a name means the subquery's own table or the query around it. Two queries that differ only in such a pick can look the same to a prover that picks wrong. So a separate reader goes through the query text, works out the owner of each bare column on its own, and compares it with what the prover chose. If they disagree, the pair is reported as unknown. If the reader cannot tell (it does not know a table's columns, or the name could mean several things), the proof stands, because refusing every such case would throw away correct proofs. This reader does not check every place the algebraic prover rewrites columns; the [full reference](../docs/proof-safeguards.md#the-provers-own-column-resolution) lists what it covers, how often it could decide on the benchmark sets, and what it cannot do.

## What if the answer is unknown?

It may mean the SQL uses an unsupported feature, a table's columns are missing, or the solver reached its time or work limit. It does not establish that the queries differ. Text that cannot be read at all (an unclosed quote, very deep nesting) and queries that would take too long to even set up (a chain of CTEs that each read the previous one twice) also come back unknown rather than as an error.

Each solver check has a fixed work limit as well as a time limit. When the work limit stops a check, the same query pair gets the same answer on a fast or a busy machine; the result says "timed out" only when the clock stopped it, which a faster machine might not. With a very small time limit the clock usually stops a check first, so whether a pair is proven or unknown can still vary with machine load; it never flips between proven and different. The bounded check follows the same work limit, and a number such as `1e100000000` is declined everywhere rather than read. `GROUP BY ALL` is read as the columns it actually groups by, so an aggregate-only query still returns its one row on an empty table.

`SELECT * EXCEPT (b)`, `* REPLACE (...)` and `* RENAME (...)` change which columns a query returns, so the provers either apply them or say unknown. Example: `SELECT * EXCEPT (b) FROM t` is no longer treated as the same query as `SELECT * FROM t`. The cases the SMT prover cannot apply (a name the star does not have, `* ILIKE`) come back unknown, and the bounded checker always declines a modified star. See the full reference for details.

A replayed counterexample does establish a difference: the report includes a database where the results disagree. Matching a few random databases does not establish that no counterexample exists. That agreement is also weaker than BigQuery agreement: the queries run on DuckDB, decimals are compared to 12 significant digits, and column types are not compared.

Two details of the structural check: it drops a result ordering only when no sort key could raise an error (a `LIMIT` that cannot cut any row does not change that), and it treats a function that might be a user-defined one as a different function when its spelling differs, because BigQuery reads those names case-sensitively.

## Comparing scripts that change a table

An `UPDATE` or `DELETE` only reports how many rows it touched, and two updates can touch the same number of rows while writing different values: `UPDATE t SET a = 1 WHERE TRUE` and `UPDATE t SET a = 2 WHERE TRUE` both touch every row. The executed comparison therefore works on a private copy of the table and compares the rows that are left afterwards, not the count. This also covers `TRUNCATE`.

Some writes cannot be compared faithfully, so the check answers `error` instead of guessing: `MERGE` and `UPDATE ... FROM` (BigQuery fails when a target row matches several source rows, while DuckDB quietly picks one), an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` with no `WHERE` clause (BigQuery rejects it), and a statement whose target table cannot be identified. The limit is that a script writing several tables is still compared on the last table it wrote. See the [full reference](../docs/provers.md) for details.

Repeating the same comparison should find the same counterexample regardless of earlier comparisons or unrelated imports. For example, removing a lookup join can lose its treatment of a user whose plan is NULL: the join drops that user, while reading the users table keeps them. The solver isolates its candidate search to avoid changing this witness with process history. The search can still miss a difference or run out of time; returned examples must respect the declared data guarantees and make the query results differ.

## Strings compared with numbers

`WHERE '2' <> 2` looks like a condition that is never true, but engines disagree: MySQL turns the string into a number and finds them equal, DuckDB and PostgreSQL cast it the same way, and BigQuery refuses the query. Treating the two as always different once led the checker to say this query matches one with no filter, when real engines return different rows.

The checkers no longer guess. When the string is a small whole number (`'2'`), MySQL, DuckDB and PostgreSQL all read it as that number, so `'2' = 2` is simply true, and a column declared as an integer compared with `'2'` is compared with `2`. BigQuery refuses such queries, so they stay "not proven" there. Any other string-versus-number comparison is treated as unknown, so `WHERE '2.5' <> 2` is "not proven" equal to the query without the filter, while two queries that make the same such comparison in the same way can still match. A few other forms (for example `IN` lists, or one column compared with both a string and a number) are simply declined. Comparing two numbers or two strings is unaffected.

The checkers also work out what kind of value a column holds from the query itself. If one table's column is matched against a string (`a.x = 'abc'`) and joined to another table's column that is matched against a number (`b.y = 0`), MySQL still joins them, because it reads `'abc'` as 0, so the checker no longer calls that query empty. The same goes for `COALESCE(n, 'abc') = 0` or a `CASE` that returns a string in one branch and a number in another, and for values that pass through a derived table or a `WITH` name. The same holds when the column passes through `SELECT *`, is written without its table name, or comes out of a `UNION`. The same holds when the column passes through `SELECT *`, is written without its table name, or comes out of a `UNION`. Columns that are only ever compared with their own kind are unaffected. One more MySQL quirk is handled: if a column has no declared type and is compared with two different strings such as `'x'` and `'y'`, an integer column holding 0 matches both, because MySQL reads any non-numeric string as 0. A claim that such a query is empty is now accepted only if it also holds when the strings are read as numbers. Declaring the column as text brings the old behavior back. See the [full reference](../docs/provers.md) for the exact list.

When results are compared by running both queries, a value keeps its kind: `TRUE` is not `1`, a NaN is not the text `NaN`, and a struct is not a list of pairs. Floats are compared rounded to 12 significant digits unless you ask for an exact comparison, and each result records which one it used.

The structural checker also refuses a query BigQuery would plainly reject (for example `HAVING` with no grouping, or a column that the subquery it reads does not have), because two such queries matching proves nothing about results. It also refuses a type name BigQuery does not have, such as `FLOAT`, `INT32` or `VARCHAR`, in a cast, an `ARRAY<...>`, a typed value or a script's column list (every prover and the bounded check do, not only the structural one) (BigQuery has `FLOAT64`, `INT64` and `STRING`), because KumoSQL would otherwise read the invalid name as the valid one and call the two casts equal. For example, `CAST(x AS FLOAT)` against `CAST(x AS FLOAT64)` is not proven. It only recognizes these cases. See the [full reference](../docs/provers.md).

## A limit that moves into a projection

KumoSQL knows that `SELECT d.b + 1 FROM (SELECT a AS b FROM t ORDER BY a LIMIT 1) AS d` returns the same row as `SELECT a + 1 FROM t ORDER BY a LIMIT 1`: it takes the first row, then computes the value. That rewrite had three holes, all now closed. When the outer query contained its own subquery, such as `(SELECT MAX(b) FROM u)`, renaming `d.b` to `a` also changed which column that subquery read, so two different queries were called equal. A value like `RAND()` that the outer query used twice would be drawn twice after the rewrite. And a `GROUP BY 1` could point at a different item once the select list changed. In each case the checker now declines, so the pair is "not proven" rather than wrongly "proven", and the common rewrites still go through. The evidence is a handful of hand-made witnesses plus fuzzing, not a proof that no such hole is left. The [full reference](../docs/provers.md) has the details.

Proofs may depend on declared keys, non-NULL columns, arithmetic assumptions, or restrictions on runtime errors. Check those before applying a change to real data. [Constraint-dependent rewrites](constraint-rewrites.md) explains data guarantees, and [bounded verification](evals/bounded-verification.md) explains the row limit.

## Numbers and errors

BigQuery numbers have traps. A whole number past about nine quadrillion loses its last digits once it meets a decimal, `0.1 + 0.2` is not `0.3`, and dividing by zero is an error. Worse, BigQuery does not promise to filter rows before it computes the select list, so `SELECT x / y FROM t WHERE y <> 0` can still divide by zero.

When you tell the prover the column types, it reads numbers the way BigQuery does and keeps track of every operation that could fail (a division, an integer overflow, a `CAST`). It then says what a rewrite does to those failures: nothing changes, it removes one that the original had, or it adds one the original did not have. In the last case it refuses to call the pair equal and shows why. For example, replacing `IF(y = 0, 0, x / y)` with `x / y` is flagged, because the `IF` was what kept the division away from zero.

A sum can fail too: adding up the numbers in a group can leave the range of a 64-bit integer. The prover compares each `SUM` group by group. If a rewrite adds up exactly the same rows, in the same groups, as the original, the two fail together. If it moves a `HAVING` on the grouping column into `WHERE`, the original also adds up the groups `HAVING` throws away, so the rewrite is safer; moving it the other way makes the rewrite add up groups the original never did, and the prover flags that and shows a small table where the sum overflows. For example, `SELECT y, SUM(x) FROM t WHERE y > 0 GROUP BY y` rewritten as `... GROUP BY y HAVING y > 0` can fail on two rows with `y = 0` and the largest integer in `x`. Anything the prover cannot match this way stays unknown, in particular a sum that is split into partial sums and added up again: whether BigQuery fails on a partial sum that overflows when the total does not is something the documentation does not settle, so the prover does not guess. Two more unverified points: that BigQuery really adds up a group that `HAVING` then drops (an optimizer may skip it), and that `SUM(DISTINCT)` and window sums fail on overflow like `SUM`.

The limits: without declared types the older, looser reading applies and the result lists that runtime errors were not modelled. Exact decimal rounding is reasoned about only for `NUMERIC` and `BIGNUMERIC` values whose number of decimal places is known (a column declared with that type, a plain decimal in quotes cast to it, and `+ - * /`, `CAST` and `ROUND` over those): `n * m` is rounded to nine places, so `ROUND(n * m, 9)` is the same number and `n / 3 * 3` is not `n`. Where the number of places is not known (a sum, a `CASE`, a floating-point value) the pair comes back unknown; the rule that products and quotients round half away from zero is not confirmed in the documentation the project has. Floating-point columns are still assumed never to hold `NaN`, and a sum of floating-point values is assumed not to depend on row order unless the two queries add the same values in the same way (an identical `SUM` or `AVG` on both sides, which the result then lists as a narrower claim) or the values are whole numbers or exact decimals (nothing is assumed); the result lists what it assumed. Adding the same decimals in a different order, or splitting one sum into two, can change the last digits, so those pairs are either listed with the order assumption or not proved. The recorded scores and the case list are in the [numeric traps eval](evals/numeric-traps.md); the details are in the [full reference](../docs/provers.md#numbers-and-runtime-errors).

## The parser is checked too

The provers also refuse to trust the parser blindly. Before a proof counts, the text is read a second time by a small separate reader that knows each engine's operator order, and if the two readings group the operators differently (for example `a | b & c` in BigQuery, or `a = b < c` in MySQL) the answer is "not proven" with the reason "parser disagreement". The limit is that this can only take proofs away, and a construct the second reader does not know is left to sqlglot's reading. See [parser checks](parser-checks.md).

## Example: grouping with a grand total

`GROUP BY ROLLUP (x)`, `CUBE` and `GROUPING SETS` can add a grand-total row, even when no input row exists, and a list that repeats a grouping set returns each group twice. A rule that assumes one row per group (summing per-group counts into one count, say) would then give a different number than the real query. KumoSQL's rules now recognise these groupings, `GROUP BY ()` and `DISTINCT ON` everywhere and decline to rewrite them, so such pairs come back unproven instead of proven. The evidence is regression pairs checked on DuckDB, so a pair that is still unproven may well be equivalent. The exact conditions are in the [full reference](../docs/provers.md).

## Example: whole numbers that turn into decimals

A database that compares a whole number with a decimal column first converts the whole number to a decimal, and a very large whole number loses its last digits in that conversion. So `a = b AND b = c` does not always mean `a = c`: 9007199254740992 and 9007199254740993 both equal the decimal 9007199254740992.0. Likewise `1e-324 < 2e-324` is false, because both literals round to zero. KumoSQL's SMT prover now models the conversion when the column types are declared, and outside BigQuery it does not treat tiny, huge or long decimal literals as exact numbers (BigQuery decimal literals are read as the nearest floating-point value, as BigQuery does). When column types are not declared, a proof that compares columns states the assumption that they have the same type. The evidence is regression pairs; the exact rules are in the [full reference](../docs/provers.md).

## Example: a clause the prover does not understand

`CAST(x AS NUMBER DEFAULT 0 ON CONVERSION ERROR)` returns 0 for a value that cannot be converted, where a plain `CAST` fails. If the prover quietly ignored the extra clause, it would call the two queries equal. Now the SMT prover checks every query for clauses it does not model (this one, `FOR UPDATE`, `CLUSTER BY`, `SETTINGS`, `SELECT` modifiers, `* EXCEPT`) and gives up on the pair instead. Some of those clauses cannot change a result, so a few pairs that are really equal now come back unproven. The evidence is a small set of regression pairs; the exact list is in the [full reference](../docs/provers.md).

## Example: a DISTINCT that can move outward

A query that removes duplicates inside a subquery, then joins it to a table on whole-number key columns, can have its duplicate removal moved to the outside when the join already makes every output row unique. KumoSQL's prover applies that move only when the columns are declared whole numbers and the joined tables' keys are fully pinned down; any grouping, limit, outer join or other twist makes it decline and leave the pair unproven. The evidence is a handful of textbook query pairs, so treat it as a narrow rule. The reference page has the exact conditions and the recorded scores: [Full reference](../docs/provers.md).

## Example: reading a value out of a repeated field

Analytics exports such as GA4 store many named values in one repeated column, and queries read one of them with a small subquery: `(SELECT value.string_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'page_location')`. Two analysts write the same lookup differently: another alias, the conditions in another order, `'page_location' = key`, or `SELECT AS VALUE`. KumoSQL now treats such a lookup as one unknown value that depends only on the array, and calls two lookups the same value only when they read alike once the wording is removed. A lookup of another key, of `int_value` instead of `string_value`, or a `MAX` over the same rows is a different value and is never matched. The proof states an assumption: BigQuery raises an error when the lookup finds more than one row, so a result exists only when at most one row matches. The limits: only a lookup whose sole source is the array qualifies (no `LIMIT`, `ORDER BY`, second source or other outer column), and the evidence is a few hand-written pairs, so a pair that stays unproven may well be equivalent. The exact conditions are in the [full reference](../docs/provers.md).
