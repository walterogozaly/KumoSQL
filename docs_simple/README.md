# KumoSQL, explained simply

KumoSQL helps you understand and change BigQuery SQL and Dataform projects. You can use it from Python, a terminal, or a browser running on your own computer.

It helps answer three everyday questions:

- If I change this column, what else might break?
- Are several queries doing work that could be shared?
- Will this new SQL return the same results as the old SQL?

Start with [Getting started](getting-started.md). It includes an example you can run without a Google Cloud account.

This folder is the plain-language companion to [the full documentation](../docs/README.md). It follows the same filenames and `evals/` structure. Each guide links to its full reference for API details and exceptions. The [project README](../README.md) has the command list and recorded benchmark scores.

## Words you will see

| Word | Plain meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Model | A query that defines a table or view in a project |
| Pipeline | Models connected by the tables they read and produce |
| Lineage | Where a table or column gets its data |
| Downstream | Something that reads this model, directly or through other models |
| CTE | A named query inside a `WITH` clause |
| SQLX | SQL with Dataform configuration and `${...}` expressions |
| Grain | What one row represents, such as one customer per day |
| Bag of rows | Rows with duplicate counts preserved; two copies differ from one |
| Counterexample | A database on which the two queries give different results |
| Eval | A repeatable test suite that measures a feature |

## Read the evidence before accepting a change

A proof establishes equivalence within the prover's supported SQL and stated assumptions. A bounded check covers every modeled database up to a row limit. An executed check compares results on particular datasets. A BigQuery dry run checks planning and schemas. These are different strengths of evidence.

`unknown` or `unproven` means KumoSQL has not established the answer. It does not mean the queries are different. The [provers guide](provers.md) explains how to read these results.
