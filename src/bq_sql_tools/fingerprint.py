"""Cheap output comparison for a pipeline before and after a refactor.

A refactor should leave every model's output unchanged. Comparing tables row
by row is expensive, so this module generates BigQuery SQL in three tiers:

* fingerprints: one aggregate scan per table giving the row count, a
  whole-row checksum and one checksum per column. Checksums are
  ``SUM(FARM_FINGERPRINT(TO_JSON_STRING(value)))`` in ``BIGNUMERIC``, so they
  ignore row order, count duplicate rows, never overflow, and treat ``NULL``
  as a value. Whole-row checksums build the row with columns sorted by name,
  so a refactor that only reorders columns still matches.
* comparison: the fingerprints of both sides joined into one row per
  ``(model, column)`` with a ``matches`` flag. A mismatching column localises
  the difference; a whole-row mismatch with every column matching means
  values moved between rows.
* drill-down: for one table, the rows whose multiplicity differs between the
  sides, or with key columns, each key that is missing, duplicated or changed
  together with the names of the columns that changed.

Fingerprint and comparison queries for a whole pipeline are single queries
that scan each table once, so they cost the bytes of the tables and return a
few rows per model. Nothing here runs a query; results are handed back to
:func:`summarize_comparison` or :func:`compare_snapshots`.

Checksums are probabilistic in principle (64-bit hashes) but a false match
needs a hash collision that cancels in a sum, which is negligible in
practice. Differences of representation are differences: ``1`` versus
``1.0`` after a type change, or a nested ``STRUCT`` whose field order
changed. Use ``normalize`` for expected noise such as float rounding, and
``ignore_columns`` for load timestamps.
