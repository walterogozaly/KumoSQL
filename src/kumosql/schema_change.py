"""What a schema change does to every model downstream: which break, which change their output schema.

``assess_schema_change`` answers "what if this table gains, loses, renames or retypes a column?" by running the
change through the pipeline: each model that reads the table, directly or through other models, is re-resolved
against the changed schema, in dependency order, and compared with how it resolves today.

* ``breaks``: the model resolved before and does not now (a column it names is gone, a bare column became
  ambiguous, the output has two columns of the same name, a ``UNION`` arm changed width).
* ``output_changes``: the model still works but its output columns differ in name, order or type. This is where
  ``SELECT *`` matters: a star passes an added, removed, renamed or retyped column on to its readers.
* ``unknown``: the model cannot be re-resolved (it did not parse, a table it reads has no known columns, a table is
  named by an unresolved template) and so is anything that reads it. An unknown is never reported as safe.

A model that breaks is assumed to be fixed with the same output it has today, so models after it are judged on their
own. Types come from ``source_schema`` and sqlglot's type inference; a type change is reported where it reaches an
output column, and is not reported as breaking (an incompatible operation on the new type is not detected).
