"""Decide whether every result of one query is also a result of another (query containment).

``check_containment(q1, q2, semantics=...)`` answers "is ``q1`` contained in ``q2``" on every
database satisfying the declared schema:

* ``semantics="set"``: every row ``q1`` returns, ``q2`` also returns (row multiplicities are ignored).
* ``semantics="bag"``: every row ``q1`` returns, ``q2`` returns at least as many times.

The two are different questions: ``SELECT x FROM t`` is set-contained in ``SELECT DISTINCT x FROM t``
and not bag-contained in it; the other direction holds in both. Answers are

* ``contained``: proven (the method is named; the algebraic prover did the proving);
* ``not_contained``: a concrete small database on which ``q1`` returns a row that ``q2`` does not
  return as often is attached (found by random search over databases that respect the schema, then
  re-run, so it is a checked fact, not a claim);
* ``unknown``: neither; the reason says why. ``unsupported`` marks shapes the decision procedures do
  not read, ``timeout`` an exhausted prover budget.

Proof methods, each reducing containment to an equivalence the prover can discharge:

* equal: ``q1`` and ``q2`` are equivalent as bags, which implies both containments;
* pre-filter: the filters of ``q1`` that ``q2`` lacks are added to ``q2`` (only on columns that
  survive any grouping) and the result is proven equivalent to ``q1``; a filtered copy of ``q2`` is
  contained in ``q2`` in every semantics, so equality with it proves ``q1`` is contained;
* post-filter: ``q1`` is rewritten as a filter over the rows of ``q2`` (the model-reuse rewriter
  restricted to an identity projection);
* distinct collapse: ``DISTINCT`` in ``q1`` only removes duplicates, so for bags it is dropped when
  ``q2`` does not have it;
* union (set semantics): ``q1 UNION q2`` is proven equivalent to ``q2 UNION q2``;
* set operations (any semantics, each step valid for bags): ``A EXCEPT B`` is within ``A``,
  ``A INTERSECT B`` within ``A`` and within ``B``, ``A UNION B`` within ``A UNION ALL B``, and a
  ``UNION ALL`` is within another when each branch is contained in its own, different branch.
