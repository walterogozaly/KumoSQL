"""Safely lift relational BigQuery subqueries into named CTEs.

The supported transformation is deliberately narrow: subqueries used as a
FROM or JOIN relation are moved into the statement's top-level WITH clause.
Scalar, EXISTS, and correlated predicate subqueries are not rewritten because
turning those into CTEs changes cardinality or correlation semantics. Neither
is a FROM/JOIN subquery that reads a relation of the enclosing query (a
correlated or lateral derived table, checked in every branch of a set
operation) or a name defined by a WITH clause nested around it: a top-level
CTE sees neither.

This module is the ``lift_subqueries`` rule in the rewrite-rule registry; the
``lift_subqueries()`` function is kept as the stable public entry point.
