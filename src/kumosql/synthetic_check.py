"""Opt-in synthetic-data evidence for rewrite results.

``attach_synthetic_check`` runs the execution harness in
:mod:`kumosql.result_equivalence` on a changed result and records one
``synthetic_results`` check on its verification. It mirrors
``attach_planner_check``: ordinary rewriting never executes anything.

Agreement on synthetic data is evidence, not proof. A passing check therefore
never changes the evidence label and never makes a result trusted. A concrete
counterexample does the opposite: it records a failed check and demotes the
result to ``unproven``, because a query pair with a known disagreeing input
must not be accepted automatically. The check's detail and evidence describe
the counterexample by seed, counts and synthetic rows only; they never contain
query text or column names, and the evidence summary reads only the check's
kind and outcome.
