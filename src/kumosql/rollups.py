"""Find existing tables that already hold an attribute at a finer grain.

When a proposed query (or model) aggregates an attribute to a coarser grain, for
example from city to state, an existing table may already hold the same
attribute at a finer grain. This module reports such tables and says whether
the coarser result can be computed from them. It builds on ``TableProfile``
(grain, attribute meaning, row scope) and the ``Check``/``MatchRole`` shapes of
``find_overlaps``.

Derivability, per target attribute and candidate table:

* ``derivable_exact``: every aggregate in the attribute decomposes (sum, count,
  min, max, and sums of products, or an average or ratio whose parts are all
  held), and the finer table's grain covers every coarser key, directly or
  through a known many-to-one mapping.
* ``derivable_with_conditions``: decomposes only if something further holds: an
  average needs the count and the sum, a ratio needs both parts (the missing
  pieces are named), or the mapping between grains changes over time.
* ``not_derivable``: distinct counts, medians, percentiles and any other
  aggregate that needs the raw rows. Informational: the table still shows where
  the raw data lives.
* ``unknown``: the mapping between the two grains is not known, or the row
  scope of the finer table cannot be lined up with the target's. The missing
  piece is named.

Every result carries the ``conditions`` that must hold and the ``missing``
pieces. A table that holds the attribute at the same grain is an overlap, not a
roll-up, and a coarser table cannot produce a finer result; both are ruled out.
Reports describe behavior only (no query text).
