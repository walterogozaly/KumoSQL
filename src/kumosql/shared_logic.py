"""Proposals to extract logic repeated across models into one shared model.

A proposal is a report only. Nothing here edits a model. ``ready`` is true only
when the refactor was applied to every copy (``refactor_sql``) and the prover
showed each edited model unchanged, so every consumer reads exactly what it
read before; the readers downstream of an edited model inherit that result.
Anything the prover cannot show, and any proposal whose reader list is
incomplete, stays ``unknown`` and not ready.

The consumer list of a proposal holds every model that would be edited (the
models containing a copy) and, through the query graph, every model that reads
one of them, directly or transitively. When the graph cannot be trusted to show
every reader, the proposal says so in ``consumers_complete`` and
``incomplete_reasons`` instead of implying the list is exhaustive.
