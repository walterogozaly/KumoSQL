"""Qualify a bare column with the source it comes from, in selects that read two or more sources.

``SELECT id, total FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.cid = c.id`` becomes
``SELECT o.id, ...`` only where the column has exactly one owner among the select's sources, so the
rewrite never has to guess. Output column names do not change: BigQuery names ``o.total`` ``total``.

Which source owns a column comes from what the query itself says (a CTE or derived table that lists its
columns, an ``UNNEST`` alias) and from the columns the loaded project and saved BigQuery catalog know for
a table (``prover_context.current_schema()``). Without those facts a plain table is unknown.

A select is left alone when it:

- reads fewer than two sources, or any source has unknown columns (a table with no known columns, a table
  function, ``PIVOT``, an unaliased ``UNNEST``, a recursive CTE), or two sources share a name;
- has a ``NATURAL`` join, whose merged columns have no single owner.

Inside a qualifying select a column stays bare when:

- it is a ``USING`` column: after ``JOIN b USING (k)`` the bare ``k`` is the merged value, and ``a.k`` is
  not the same for an outer join;
- two sources have it (the query is ambiguous as written) or none has it (a correlated reference to an
  outer select, a pseudo column such as ``_PARTITIONTIME``);
- it names a source, an ``UNNEST`` value or offset (``FROM UNNEST(xs) AS x`` makes ``x`` the element);
- it names a SELECT alias in GROUP BY, HAVING, QUALIFY or ORDER BY, where the alias takes the name;
- it is in the statement's final ORDER BY, because verification only accepts a rewrite that leaves the
  ordering text exactly as it was;
- it sits inside a star's ``EXCEPT``, ``REPLACE`` or ``RENAME``, where BigQuery reads bare names;
- it belongs to a set operation's own ORDER BY or LIMIT, or to the ORDER BY of a parenthesized query, which name output columns;
- it sits where only some of the sources are readable and its owner is not one of them: a JOIN ... ON reads the sources up to
  and including its own join, and an ``UNNEST`` argument reads only the sources before it (a later source's column of the same
  name means an outer column there; checked on BigQuery);
- it is spelled like an output name that is not a plain column of this select (the field of ``s.f``, a ``* REPLACE`` alias), in
  GROUP BY, HAVING, QUALIFY, ORDER BY or a named window;
- it is an argument of a function and is spelled like a date part (``FOO(d, MONTH)`` parses ``MONTH`` as a column).

A relation whose columns are not certain is unknown: a ``SELECT AS VALUE`` or ``SELECT AS STRUCT`` derived table, a set
operation that matches columns by name, and a table that carries a pivot or another clause beyond an alias, a snapshot or a sample.

The independent check ``proof_qualify`` re-derives every one of these decisions from the SQL alone.

Statements that change data (UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE) are left alone.
