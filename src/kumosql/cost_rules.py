"""Catalog of cost rewrite rules.

A cost rule changes the work a query does, not just how it reads. Each rule
ships on its own with three things: the conditions under which it is safe, what
evidence a reviewer needs, and a measured outcome that stays unknown until the
saving is measured on real jobs. Rules not yet built are listed as
``not_implemented`` so the catalog shows the intended scope without claiming it.

``rule_catalog()`` returns the ``rules[]`` shape documented in
``docs/ui-roadmap.md``: ``id``, ``name``, ``state``, ``safe_when``,
``requires`` and ``outcome``, plus ``measured_outcome`` (null until measured).
