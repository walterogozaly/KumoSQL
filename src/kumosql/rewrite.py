"""Apply registered rewrite rules and check each output for equivalence.

Every changed output is compared with its input by the conservative prover in
``kumosql.equivalence``. Each result has one evidence label and separate
records for the checks that support it. Only ``unchanged`` and ``proven`` are
trusted for automatic acceptance; a fatal rule failure is labeled ``failed``.

Statements are checked pairwise. For ``CREATE ... AS`` and ``INSERT ...
SELECT`` the statement text around the query must be unchanged and the
queries must be proven equivalent. Other statements must render identically.
Dataform SQLX is checked by requiring config/js/operation blocks to be
identical and treating each ``${...}`` interpolation as an opaque fragment
identified by its text. Only ``ref()``, ``resolve()`` and ``self()`` are
faithful as a name; a changed statement holding any other expression outside
a string literal is unproven until the SQLX is compiled (``sqlx_fragments``).
