"""Find existing tables that already provide what a query (or model) computes.

Copied SQL is found by text similarity. This module finds the same *meaning*: it
compares the ``TableProfile`` of the target (a proposed query, or an existing
model) with the profile of every other model, so renamed columns, re-cased
names, views and chains of CTEs do not hide a match. Names, formatting and
shared source columns never produce a match on their own.

Match kinds, from strongest to weakest:

* ``same_meaning`` (``high``): every attribute of the target has the same
  meaning as an attribute of the candidate, the grain keys mean the same, and the
  row scope is identical and comparable.
* ``contains`` (``medium``): same attributes and grain, and the candidate's
  filters are a strict subset of the target's, so the target can filter it.
* ``partial`` (``low``): some attributes match at the same grain, or all do but
  the row scope differs or cannot be compared.
* ``unknown``: the comparison could not be made (grain or lineage unknown on
  either side). The reason is listed; it is never a match.

Every match lists its checks (``lineage``, ``grain``, ``row_scope``), each
``matched``, ``differs`` or ``unknown``. A different grain is not a match. The
result always states how many tables were compared and how many were skipped and
why; "no match" is never reported without those counts. Reports describe
behavior only (no query text).
