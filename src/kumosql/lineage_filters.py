"""The conditions that limit which rows reach each output column of a model.

Column lineage says which source columns a value is built from. It does not say that the rows were
filtered on the way: a ``COALESCE`` built in a CTE keeps its sources, and the ``WHERE week = ...`` of
the query that reads the CTE is invisible. ``model_filters`` lists those conditions for one qualified
query: every ``WHERE``, ``JOIN ... ON`` / ``USING``, ``HAVING`` and ``QUALIFY`` in the select that makes
the column and in every CTE, derived table and set-operation branch it reads (including inputs that are
only joined in), each with the scope it was written in and the source columns it reads.

How a condition affects the output rows is its ``effect``:

* ``limits_rows``: rows that fail it do not reach the output (a ``WHERE``, an inner join's ``ON``, a filter
  inside an input that is inner-joined or is the preserved side of an outer join).
* ``matches_only``: it decides which rows pair up, not whether a row survives (the ``ON`` of an outer
  join, and any filter inside the input that an outer join may null-extend). Rows without a match stay.
* ``excludes_rows``: filters inside the right side of ``EXCEPT``, which decides which rows are removed.
* ``feeds_value``: filters of a scalar subquery in the select list, which limit the rows that one
  column's value is computed from, not the model's own rows.

Nothing here is guessed: a condition that cannot be attributed to source columns is listed without
them and flagged ``columns_complete=False``; a model whose scopes cannot be built has no filters
(``None``), which callers report as unknown rather than as "no filters".
