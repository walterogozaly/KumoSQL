"""Blast radius of a proposed change: who is affected, and who cannot be checked.

``assess_change`` answers "what breaks if I change this?" for one column or
table. It is a read-only walk over what the pipeline analysis already knows:
the models that read the target (from column consumption, so a column used
only in a filter, join or grouping is found too) and the columns computed from
it (lineage). Readers the analysis cannot read are never dropped from the
answer: they are listed as ``unknown``. Readers outside the pipeline (jobs,
dashboards, scripts that are not parsed) are invisible here, so the result
never claims that a target is safe to remove.

Job history adds the readers no compiled model declares. Given observed reads,
tables that jobs read from the target (or from an affected model) but that no
declared model reads are listed under ``observed``, labeled with when they were
last seen and how confident the edge is. Job history names tables, not
columns, so their column use is unverified: the effect is ``may_break`` or
``may_change``, never ``breaks``. A reader already listed as affected or
unknown is not repeated.
